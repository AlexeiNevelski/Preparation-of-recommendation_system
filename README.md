# Preparation-of-recommendation_system
In this project I analyze sales of online courses for an imaginary online-school MasterMind to create a base for a future recommendation system using SQL and Python.

This was my final project in online-school SkillFactory.

In the first part, I analyzed datasets in Metabase using SQL and loaded the necessasy data into .ipynb file.
In the second part, I found the best recommendations for the online courses.
The third part was to create a final table with recommendations.
In fourth part, I executed an A/B-test using imaginary data to evaluate efficiency of our recommendation system.
